This Python script is designed to download all posts from a public Instagram profile and organize them into batches for easy management. It uses the Instaloader library to download posts and saves them in a directory named after the profile name.

When executed, the script prompts the user to enter the profile name, batch size, and confirms if they want to run the program again. The batch size determines the number of posts to be saved in a single batch. The maximum batch size is equal to the number of posts on the profile.

The script checks if the profile exists and if it is private. If the profile does not exist or is private, the program prompts the user to enter the profile name again or exit the program.

Once the posts are downloaded, the script organizes them into batches based on the specified batch size. Each batch is saved in a separate directory named Batch_n, where n is the batch number. The script also creates a Metadata directory to store the JSON metadata files associated with each post.

Finally, the script archives the entire profile directory as a ZIP file and prompts the user if they want to run the program again.

1.Install the required Instaloader library.
2.Run the script using Python.
